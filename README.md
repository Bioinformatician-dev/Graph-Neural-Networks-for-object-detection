# Graph-Neural-Networks-for-object-detection
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance object detection involves modeling the relationships between detected objects, which can improve accuracy and contextual understanding.

## Overview of GNNs in Object Detection
Detection Phase: Use a traditional object detection method (like Faster R-CNN, YOLO, etc.) to get bounding boxes and class labels for objects in an image.

## Graph Construction:

Treat each detected object as a node in a graph.Define edges based on relationships such as spatial proximity, semantic similarity, or co-occurrence in the same image.

## GNN Processing:

Use a GNN to learn from the graph representation, allowing it to capture contextual relationships between objects.

## Output Phase: 
Use the output from the GNN to refine object classifications, enhance bounding box predictions, or infer additional relationships.

## Installation
Make sure you have the required libraries:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torch-geometric
```
## Instruction

* Prepare Detected Objects: Replace the example detected_objects array with the output from your actual object detection model.

* Edge Construction: The create_edges function uses bounding box overlap for edge creation. You can modify this to include additional criteria based on your needs.

* Run the Code: Save the script as gnn_detection.py and execute it

 ```bash
python gnn_detection.py
```
